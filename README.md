# MP3 Software Player

# Description
The software we want to make is a windows system that can of course play local MP3 files but also propose a lot of features/services to the user.
By sending his track to an internal server, the clients will get his files analyzed and get a text file in return that contains the information of his music.
Using this file text, the software will be able to use the information to execute the different features and functions explained behind.
